  "text": "Alice: Good morning everyone. Let's start with the project status update. Bob: Sure. We've completed the API integration last week. The backend is now fully functional. Charlie: That's great news. I've been working on the frontend components. Should be ready for testing by Friday. David: I have a question about the database schema. Are we still planning to add the user preferences table? Alice: Yes, that's on the roadmap. Let's discuss the timeline. Bob: I think we should prioritize the authentication module first. It's blocking several other features. Charlie: Agreed. I'll need the auth endpoints to complete the login page. David: I can help with the database migrations once we finalize the schema. Alice: Perfect. Let's set a deadline for the auth module. How about next Wednesday? Bob: That works for me. I'll create the initial PR by Monday for review. Charlie: I'll coordinate with Bob on the frontend integration. David: And I'll prepare the database scripts. Alice: Great. Any other items to discuss? Bob: Just a reminder about the code review process. Please review PRs within 24 hours. Charlie: Noted. I have a few pending reviews I'll complete today. David: Same here. Alice: Alright, I think we covered everything. Let's reconvene next week. Thanks everyone!",
